        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
        leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
                Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
                point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
                the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.[2]

                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King Fundin, the
                father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
                Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the
                Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to
                reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as
                they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled
                in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

                accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
                advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.
